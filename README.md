I’m a versatile and solutions-oriented full-stack developer with extensive experience building scalable web and backend applications using Python, Vue.js, PHP, and Java. I specialize in delivering high-performance, user-focused software by combining strong programming fundamentals with a sharp eye for design and UX.

Over the years, I’ve led and contributed to full-lifecycle development across various industries, from enterprise dashboards and business applications to automation tools and intelligent bots. I thrive in agile environments and excel at bridging the gap between frontend interactivity and backend logic.
